# Git flow example (v.0.3.0)
This is a brief explanation of how to build a project using git flow.

I have intentionally added branches that should not appear (feature, release...) to see their structure.

## What is git flow?
Git flow is an amazing branching method for Git.

### Methodology



| Plugin | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| Master | Is our **production branch** (without no errors) |
| Develop | Is the main branch we are going to work |
| Feature | If we want to develop a new feature we must to create a new branch of this type |
| Release | When we are satisfied with our results, we must create this kind of branch |
| Hotfix | A hotfix branch must be incorporated to both develop and master branches (bugs on production!!) |
